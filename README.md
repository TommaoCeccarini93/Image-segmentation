# Image segmentation with active contour model
Removing the background from a set of images in a folder using active contour model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_contour_model.

This project also contains the results obtained on the test sets https://gitlab.com/photogrammetry-test-sets/skull-turntable-strong-lights-no-background-dotted and https://gitlab.com/photogrammetry-test-sets/skull-turntable-strong-lights-no-background-dotted-shallow-dof.

To repeat the experiments on the same test-sets you need to delete the 'skull-turntable-no-background' and 'skull-turntable-shallow-dof-no-background' folders.

# Image segmentation with active contour model

Removing the background from a set of images in a folder using Active contour model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_contour_model.

The project also contains the result of running the software on the test set https://gitlab.com/photogrammetry-test-sets/skull-turntable-strong-lights-no-background-dotted.

To repeat the experiment on the same test-set you need to delete the 'skull-turntable-no-background' folder.
